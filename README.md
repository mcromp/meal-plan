## Meal Plan

Meal Plan is a web app that enables a user to plan out the food for the duration of the 7 upcoming days.

- First the user either creates or selects username.
- The user is then presented with a calendar containing the 7 upcoming days.
- The user clicks on one of the 7 days and is then taken to a page containing food items.

- The user 'adds' food items to the selected calendar date.
- After user 'submits' the added food items they appear on the 7 day calendar.
